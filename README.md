Project Title

Conducted sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews using NLP techniques, applying text preprocessing, vectorization, Bag of Words and TF-IDF, and supervised machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest) to classify user opinions. Gained hands-on experience with Python, scikit-learn, SpaCy, and data visualization.

## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->


Understanding public sentiment is essential for any business aiming to improve customer satisfaction and service quality as this project aims to explore how Natural Language Processing can be used to classify reviews as positive or negative, for consumers to make informed choices, and restaurants to gain actionable feedback. 

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->


Compared Model Performance
Highest accuracy achieved with Linear SVC (81.2%) using TF-IDF and lemmatized text.
Noted that Naive Bayes underperformed after lemmatization due to sparsity in the feature space.
Visualized Key Insights
Created bar charts and confusion matrices to show:
Distribution of sentiment classes.
Performance of each model.
